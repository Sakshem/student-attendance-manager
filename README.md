# Student-Attendance-Manager
* Built a Web Spring-boot Application that tracks student attendance. Allows teachers to record the attendance for a new day, view and update a student's past attendance by simplifying the User Interface
* Performs all the CRUD operations on the students records and stores it in a MySQL database
* Added Spring Security with JDBC authentication and deployed 3 different roles Student, Teacher and Admin with different capabilities
* Automated generation of student attendance records for each new date when selected through the filter
* Used Thymeleaf for the dynamic content of the web and HTML5, CSS for the static content of the web
